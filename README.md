# Credit Risk Classification
   
   Supervised Machine Learning



## Analysis Overview

Build a model to identify the loan risk of borrowers from a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company.

### DATA
The dataset provides the following historical lending activity data:

           loan_size
           interest_rate
           borrower_income
           debt_to_income
           num_of_accounts
           derogatory_marks
           total_debt
           loan_status
           
The "Loan Status" column value indicates the risk of a defaulting          
          
           0 = loan is healthy
           1 = high risk of default              

### Machine Learning Process

   * Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets:

           Labels: y = "loan status" column        
           Features: X = all other columns
     
   * Create a Logistic Regression Model

   * Evaluate Performance
     
           Confusion Matrix

           Classification Report

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
  * Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.


* Machine Learning Model 2:
  * Description of Model 2 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.

## Summary

Summarise the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:
* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.

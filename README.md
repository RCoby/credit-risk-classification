# Credit Risk Classification
   
   Supervised Machine Learning



## Analysis Overview

Identify the loan risk of borrowers from a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company with a Machine Learning Model 

### Dataset
* The dataset provides the following historical lending activity data

                    loan_size
                    interest_rate
                    borrower_income
                    debt_to_income
                    num_of_accounts
                    derogatory_marks
                    total_debt
                    loan_status
           
* The "Loan Status" column indicates if the loan is healthy or at risk of a defaulting
  
      Column Values:
                    0 = healthy loan
                    1 = high-risk loan              

* Label/s set and Features dataset

            Labels: y = "loan status" column
          Features: X = remaining columns

* Split the Data into Training and Testing datasets

## Results

Logistic Regression Model:
* Balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of the machine learning model.
  
  * Accuracy - correct prediction % overall of true pos/neg
                
  * Precision - correct positive predictions
    
  * Recall


## Summary

* Although the model demonstrats extreemly high accuracy for the "0" label, the accuracy drop for label "1" has the potential to expose a creditor to an unsatisfactory level of risk. 
* As the purpose of the model is to determine the creditworthiness of browers I am hesitant to recomend this model on the basis of the results without further information relating to what the creditors deems an acceptable level of risk.
